          <h2>Hello, I'm Rozy!</h2>
          <!--Brief Introduction-->
          <p>I am a first-year MA Computing Student at the University of Aberdeen. In 2023 I earned my DipHE in History and Criminology from the University of The Highlands and Islands. I enjoy being creative, but I also don't mind research and data intensive tasks. One thing I don't enjoy, however, I talking about myself. Bellow you can see projects I have worked on or am currently working on. You are also able to download my resume. <br>Thank you for visiting!<br></p>

          <p>I am an e-commerce and social media intern for Earthstore. Earthstore is a family run buisness here in Aberdeen. At the moment the store is only online but it used to sell from the Urban Wellness Hub, which is also run by the Ross (Earthstore) family</p>

          <p>I am also working on another Shopify website at the moment. This is for my mother's buisness. She too is very creative like me, but unfortunately the day is not long enough and she cannot jungle a website as well. Thus, I have offered to help her with that.</p>

          <p>BULyarns is a project I worked on a while ago in 2020. It was made using WordPress and the person that commisionned me for it, comissioned me for two other websites. One that was an e-commerce website on WordPress again, and the other was just a blog style website for the chamber of commerce Montana.</p>

            <h4>Edamam API</h4>
          </a>
          <p>I have taken part in quite a few Code First Girls courses/MOOCs. During the Introduction to Python course sponsored by J. P. Morgan we were given a couple challenges. We were to pick one and that would be our final project. The project I selected was a recipe generator using the Edamam API. I developed it with the help of one othe course mate, as we were the only 'brave' ones to take on the task.</p>

          <p>Aaaaaaaand another Code First Girls MOOC, but this one was Machine Learning...with a sprinkle of Python. And if you are wondering if Python is my favourite language, no. Not it isn't. I don't know how this happened.</p>

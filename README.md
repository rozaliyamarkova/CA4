This website portfolio was designed to represent who I am as a character. Somebody who is bubbly, loves cutesy stuff and 'soft' projects. Hence why the website is pink. However, I realise that not everyone likes the style that I do and under no circumstance do I want to limit myself. I give more importance to turning people's ideas into reality, than only working on projects that are my style. Thus I have utilised the About page to display projects that I have worked on. I hope these projects showcase that I can create designs that are clean/minimalistic, also ones that are a bit more sophisticated, and really just any design.


The greatest trouble I encountered while working on this project was to work with CODIO. Although I have completed other assessments and homework via CODIO, this assessment was exceptionally hard. At the beginning of me working on this project, I wanted to erase my work and start on a blank slate. I tried just about everything - reseting the box, erasing the files, it was just not working, the files would remained. Until, I had finally managed to sort out the troubles I was having and had fixed the mistakes in my code, that I accidentally closed the terminal and that erased all my work. 


CODIO also randomly disconnects, randomly decides it will not push commits to GitHub, and a plethora of other small hiccups. However, I am happy to have made often commits as I could just clone the repository again and it would fix the issue. 


Another trouble I encountered was working with the code provided for the chat app. Although i understood the purpose of each line of code, I struggled to work with it. This is why I followed a tutorial by Traversy Media, and reworked their code to fit my needs and vision. 

The chat has been redesigned so that users are able to choose their own username, which was previously impossible as they were given a randomised username. Users are also able to enter a chat room name, this way there can be multiple rooms active at once. When a user types, another user is able to see that. The time a message is sent is also visible. I have also made it so that the chat opens in another tab.
